Work list:

Main Menu         started

Player            not started
Override Pause    not started

There's plenty to do here...

Notes:

Tiled level editor looks AWESOME.  Definitely going to use that for the level editor.
xSGE should be able to help with that.
Note to self: xSGE can't really help on the graphical end of things.

"Rooms" need to have objects formed _outside_ of their scope and placed inside by
the constructor, and, like magic, they will show up in the room.
Things to do because of this:
  - Room "generator": makes certain kinds of rooms, ie: Menu, level, etc.
  - uhhhh
  -text font element to room generator/etc.

Fun fact: Module import can be done via a string, which would potentially allow
a level to be loaded from the JSON file, given that a .py file is linked...
This leads to many custom levels, full overloading, etc.  Sounds amazing for fan-levels.
